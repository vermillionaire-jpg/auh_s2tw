### All Under Heaven Mod (Shogun 2 TW)

Battle Map
-------------------------
- Extended camera, default camera sits too low.
- Mitigate Pullthrough Exploit: Cavalry vs spear infantry, having some pullthrough is fine versus swords and other cav.
Some pullthrough should be kept in the game as it offers tradeoffs, additionally the AI also inadvertently makes use of
such mechanics via attack orders and we don't want to punish it severely here.
- Buff Swords
- Remove Spearwall and most active abilties, rely more on passives, no loose formation.


Campaign
-------------------------
- Revamp general skill tree.
- Rebalance Upkeep and building structures to encourage more monk and samurai based compositions.
- Revamp the Tech Tree
- Nerf agents, otherwise you can seize the ninja provinces in the middle and destroy the AI.
- Change faction bonuses to be more impactful
- See what s2tw allows in terms of scripting (TBD)
- Misc. Bug Fixes

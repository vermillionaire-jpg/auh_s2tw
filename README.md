S2tw Mod Implementation
-------------------------
- Revamp game to have more variety and fix bugs. Overhaul the game to encourage
more varied army compositions more along the lines of Age of Charlemagne DLC for
Attila TW.
- Campaign Should have more variety beyond tier 1 units and tier 1 building spam,
giving more weight towards teching up and recruiting higher tier units along with
having more immediate payoffs for higher tier buildings.

Battle Map
-------------------------
- Normalize Samurai, Monk, & Ashigaru Unit sizes (Infantry)
- Improve cavalry performance/ viability in campaign
- Rebalance combat to encourage mixed compositions vs yari ash + bow ash t1 spam until victory.
- Remove spearwall from yari ashigaru and long yari
- Look into Tweaking special units like kisho ninjas and heroes
- Look into if bows should be buffed, guns all rank fire and adjusting projectile behavior and stats (maybe adjust velocity also)
- extended camera
- Mitigate Pullthrough Exploit
